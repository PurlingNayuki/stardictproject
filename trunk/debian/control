Description: International dictionary for GNOME 2
 StarDict is a cross-platform and international dictionary written in
 GTK+ 2.x.  It has powerful features such as "Glob-style pattern
 matching", "Scan selection word", "Fuzzy search", etc.
 .
 This package is compiled with GNOME 2 support and contains only the
 program of stardict and will be of limited use without the dictionary
 files. For more information about how to get the dictionary files,
 please read /usr/share/doc/stardict/README.Debian.
